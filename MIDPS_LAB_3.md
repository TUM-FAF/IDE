Laboratorul Nr.3 - GUI Programing
Virtosu Sava
email: sava.virtosu@gmail.com
*******************************************************************************
Skills:
	- IDE's: [Visual Studio, QTCreator, Code::Blocks]
	- Languages: C/C++,C#,Python,Basic,Delphi...
	- Frameworks: Forms, wxWidgets.
	- Technologies: PyQt.
*******************************************************************************
Objectives: 
	- Make a simple GUI Calculator  
	- Default operations are: +,-,*,/,power,sqrt,SignInversion(+/-),operation 
	with decimal floating point.
	- Divide your program in two modules - the GUI module and Core Module.
	- Possibility to plot Graphs giving as an argument a function
*******************************************************************************
General Requirements:
	Laboratory work is considered as successfully passed after fulfilling the 
	following steps:
		1. You must elaborate a Report, in witch you describe your work-flow 
		and the way you are thinking:
			- Laboratory work paper DL is: x.x.x
			- Laboratory work paper must have at least: 4 pages and 
			2 screen-shots
			- Laboratory work paper must have a conclusion of: 0.5 page
		2. You must elaborate a prototype program, and show how it works during
		the classes
		3. You must pass the quiz 
*******************************************************************************
Technical Requirements:
	- You must separate your application in two modules:
		- Core module - must include the basic functionality, storing the 
		- GUI module - must include bunch of function that draw the GUI and
		manage the interaction between GUI elements and the core function
	- Try to make your program cross platform (Windows,Linux,Mac).

*******************************************************************************
Laboratory Requirements:

	- Basic Level (grade 5 || 6): Make a simple GUI calculator with basic 
	functions such as +, -, /, *.

	- Normal Level (grade 7 || 8): Make a simple GUI calculator with basic 
	functions such as +, -, /, *, power, sqrt, SignInversion(+/-). 

	- Advance Level (grade 9 || 10):Make a simple GUI calculator with basic 
	functions such as +, -, /, *, power, sqrt and SignInversion(+/-), operation
	with decimal floating point. Your program must contain two modules, the GUI
	module and Business Logic module.

	- Bonus Level: Your Business Logic module (the Core module), that 
	represents a bunch of function that	takes some arguments and return the
	result, must be separated as a library that ca be easily included or 
	accessed in other applications or from the console. Your calculator will be
	able to plot basic 2D graphs, by giving as an input a function, and obtain
	as a result a window with drawn graph.

	hs/more_graphs.htm

	x + y = 4 

	Result:

	y = 3x + 1 
	
	Result:

	*NOTE: I suggest you to take a look at QTDesigner for constructing GUI, and
	Python language for Core logic. This Technology binding is named PyQT, and 
	is very interesting imho. If you will make your laboratory work using this 
	technology, take a look at "pyuic" utility. Using this utility you can 
	easily convert your *.ui file in to python code:
	"pyuic form1.ui > form1.py"
