### Prerequisites:
  - IDEs: console
  - Languages: bash, C/C++
  - Frameworks: 
  - Technologies: Version Control Systems

### Objectives: 
  - Understanding and using console (basic level) 
  - Administration of a remote linux machine using SSH
  - Ability to work with Version Control Systems (git || mercurial || svn)
  - Compile your C/C++/Java/Python programs in console using gcc/g++/javac/python compilers

### General Requirements:
  Laboratory work is considered as successfully passed after fulfilling the following steps:
  
  1. You must elaborate a Report which will contain your work-flow and your conclusions.
    - Laboratory work paper Dead Line is: x.x.x
    - Laboratory work paper must have at least: 2 pages
    - Laboratory work paper must have a conclusion of: 0.5 pages
  2. You must elaborate a prototype program, and show how it work during the classes
  3. You must pass the quiz 

  _Note: More details you'll provide in your report, less questions I'll give to
  you during presentation of your report._

  _Note*:_
  
  - _If you don't understand some words in this document please google it._
  - _If you don't understand google explanation then try to ask for a help from colleagues or friends._
  - _If you still don't get something then ask me. Write an email to me or to other teacher. Ask stackoverflow. Do something (!) because you will encounter all these keywords during your professional carrier. This will help to differentiate you from an average "b√Ædlo-coder"._

### Technical Requirements:
  - connect to a server (you can use a virtual machine as a remote server)
  - install necessary compilers on server
  - install git on server

### Laboratory Requirements:

  - Basic Level (grade 5 || 6): You need to connect to a server (as a server can serve a virtual machine) using ssh. You must be able to run at least 2 sample programs from the HelloWolrdPrograms folder. You must be able to initialize and make a commit in git or mercurial.
  - Normal Level (grade 7 || 8): initialize an empty repository, configure your git or mercurial. Make 2 branches, and make in each branch a commit.
  - Advance Level (grade 9 || 10): configure your remote push (github, bitbucket or custom server). Make a commit and after that reset it. Make 2 branches and merge them.
